# Inventory-Management-System
This is the inventory management system I created for my senior project in college. It is still being updated and finished. 
This will eventually become open-source software for small businesses to use.

Microsoft SQL Server 2019 Express must be installed for this software to work properly. 
Additionally, it should be noted that this software hasn't been completely finished and when using it you may experience some bugs taht sitll need finished.
